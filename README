Golint is a linter for Go source code.

To install, run
  go get github.com/golang/lint/golint

Invoke golint with one or more filenames or directories.
The output of this tool is a list of suggestions in Vim quickfix format,
which is accepted by lots of different editors.

Golint differs from govet. Govet is concerned with correctness, whereas
golint is concerned with coding style. Golint is in use at Google, and it
seeks to match the accepted style of the open source Go project.

The suggestions made by golint are exactly that: suggestions.
Golint is not perfect, and has both false positives and false negatives.
Do not treat its output as a gold standard. We will not be adding pragmas
or other knobs to suppress specific warnings, so do not expect or require
code to be completely "lint-free".
In short, this tool is not, and will never be, trustworthy enough for its
suggestions to be enforced automatically, for example as part of a build process.

If you find an established style that is frequently violated, and which
you think golint could statically check, file an issue at
  https://github.com/golang/lint/issues


Vim
---
Add this to your ~/.vimrc:
  exe "set rtp+=" . globpath($GOPATH, "src/github.com/golang/lint/misc/vim")

Running :Lint will run golint on the current file and populate the quickfix list.
